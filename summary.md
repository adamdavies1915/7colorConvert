# 7colorConvert

A web-based image converter that transforms any image into a 7-color palette optimized for e-ink display frames. Users can drag and drop images which are then dithered using Floyd-Steinberg algorithm and output as 800x480 or 480x800 BMP files ready for e-ink devices. Built to solve the niche problem of preparing photos for 7-color e-ink picture frames that require specific color palettes (black, white, green, blue, red, yellow, orange). Static HTML/CSS/JS served via nginx in Docker for easy self-hosting.
